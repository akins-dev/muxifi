# Contribution Guidelines

These guidelines exist to ensure clean code practices are maintained whilst still having a lot of fun (since this project is for the [Moralis/Google Hackathon][0] 🤓).

-   Generally, except for cases where absolutely needed, all additions/deletions from this project would be done via PRs which does not ideally require approval but would be nice if it was.

-   Ideally, contribution is access based and only [members of the team][1] have the **exclusive rights** to merge PRs without fail. Non-members would require at least 1 approval from a [team member][1] to contribute to this repo.

- Ensure `husky` is properly installed and working

-   Ideally, All branch names should follow a general pattern `[type]/[descriptive-name]`.
-   Ideally, All commits should also follow this pattern `[type]([scope]): [some action taken]`.
-   Ideally, PR titles should also follow a similar pattern `[type]([scope]): [some descriptive action]`.
-   The accepted branch/commits/pr types include:

    -   `feat`: features additions
    -   `fix`: bug fixes
    -   `chore`: non-functional code changes
    -   `docs`: addition/deletion/update of documentation

-   Avoid unnecessarily long PRs/Branch names while being as descriptive as possible.

> May the **Code** be with you 🙏
